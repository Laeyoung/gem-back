## 🔍 Key Metrics to Monitor

### Error Metrics

```
Target Thresholds:
- Overall Error Rate: <0.1%
- SDK-Related Errors: 0
- Authentication Errors: 0 (unless actual auth issues)
- Rate Limit Errors: <0.05% (depends on usage)
```

**What to Look For:**
- Sudden spikes in error rate
- New error types not seen before
- Patterns in error timing (specific hours, days)
- Errors related to specific models

**Alert Triggers:**
- Error rate >1% for >5 minutes
- Any errors containing "GoogleGenAI", "@google/genai", or SDK-related stack traces
- Sudden increase in timeout errors

### Performance Metrics

```
Target Ranges (compared to pre-migration baseline):
- Average Response Time: ±10%
- P95 Response Time: ±15%
- P99 Response Time: ±20%
- Throughput: ≥95% of baseline
```

**What to Look For:**
- Gradual degradation over time
- Sudden performance drops
- Response time spikes during peak hours
- Memory leaks (increasing memory usage over time)

**Alert Triggers:**
- Average response time >20% slower than baseline
- P99 >3 seconds (was ~2s before)
- Memory usage increasing >10% per hour

### SDK-Specific Metrics

```
Client Caching:
- Cache Hit Ratio: >80% (after 1 hour warmup)
- Cache Size: <100 entries (typical)
- Cache Memory: <5MB

API Calls:
- generateContent() success rate: >99.9%
- generateContentStream() success rate: >99.9%
- No "text is undefined" errors
```

**What to Look For:**
- Low cache hit ratio (<50%)
- Unbounded cache growth
- Failures in response text extraction
- Streaming interruptions

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Watch

### Priority 1: Breaking Issues (Fix Immediately)

**Symptoms:**
- ❌ Error rate >5%
- ❌ Complete service outage
- ❌ All requests failing to specific model
- ❌ Memory leak causing crashes

**Action:**
1. Roll back to previous version immediately
2. Review error logs for root cause
3. Contact team for emergency fix
4. Document incident for post-mortem

### Priority 2: Degradation Issues (Fix Within 24h)

**Symptoms:**
- ⚠️ Error rate 1-5%
- ⚠️ Response time >50% slower
- ⚠️ Intermittent failures
- ⚠️ Cache not working properly

**Action:**
1. Investigate root cause
2. Check if issue is environment-specific
3. Review recent code changes
4. Prepare hot-fix if needed
5. Monitor closely for escalation

### Priority 3: Minor Issues (Fix Within Week)

**Symptoms:**
- ⚡ Error rate 0.1-1%
- ⚡ Response time 10-50% slower
- ⚡ Edge case failures
- ⚡ Suboptimal cache performance

**Action:**
1. Log detailed information
2. Create bug report
3. Schedule fix in next release
4. Add to known issues list

## 📝 Known Edge Cases to Monitor

### 1. Response Text Extraction
**Issue:** `result.text` might be `undefined` in rare cases
**Symptom:** Empty response text, "cannot read property 'text'" errors
**Monitor:** Error logs for text-related errors
**Mitigation:** Fallback to empty string (`??` operator already in place)

### 2. Streaming Chunk Handling
**Issue:** Streaming chunks might not have text property
**Symptom:** Missing chunks, incomplete responses
**Monitor:** Streaming response completeness
**Mitigation:** Skip chunks with empty text (already implemented)

### 3. Client Cache Memory
**Issue:** Unbounded cache growth with many unique API keys
**Symptom:** Increasing memory usage over time
**Monitor:** Process memory usage, cache size
**Mitigation:** Call `clearCache()` periodically if needed

### 4. Multi-Key Rotation
**Issue:** Some keys might be invalid or rate-limited
**Symptom:** Higher error rate, fallback to fewer keys
**Monitor:** Per-key error rates in statistics
**Mitigation:** Remove invalid keys from rotation

### 5. Model-Specific Failures
**Issue:** Specific Gemini model might be unavailable
**Symptom:** Failures for one model, success for others
**Monitor:** Model usage statistics, model health
**Mitigation:** Verify fallback chain is working

## 📈 Metrics Collection Examples

### Application Logs

```typescript
// Log SDK-related events
logger.info('SDK Migration - Request completed', {
  model: response.model,
  responseTime: duration,
  cacheHit: wasCacheHit,
  tokenUsage: response.usage?.totalTokens,
  success: true
});

logger.error('SDK Migration - Request failed', {
  model: attemptedModel,
  error: error.message,
  stack: error.stack,
  apiKey: apiKeyIndex, // Don't log actual key
});
```

### Daily Summary Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily migration metrics summary

echo "=== SDK Migration Daily Summary ==="
echo "Date: $(date)"
echo ""

echo "Total Requests:"
grep "Request completed" app.log | wc -l

echo "Total Errors:"
grep "Request failed" app.log | wc -l

echo "Error Rate:"
# Calculate and display error percentage

echo "Average Response Time:"
# Extract and calculate average from logs

echo "Cache Hit Ratio:"
grep "cacheHit: true" app.log | wc -l
# Calculate percentage
```

### Health Check Endpoint

```typescript
// Add migration health check
app.get('/health/sdk-migration', async (req, res) => {
  const client = new GeminiClient();

  try {
    // Quick health check with cached client
    const start = Date.now();
    await client.generate('ping', 'gemini-2.5-flash', apiKey);
    const duration = Date.now() - start;

    res.json({
      status: 'healthy',
      sdk: '@google/genai@1.33.0',
      responseTime: duration,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      status: 'unhealthy',
      error: error.message,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
});
```

# Monitor response times
grep "responseTime" app.log | awk '{sum+=$NF; count++} END {print sum/count}'

# Check cache hit ratio
echo "Cache Hits: $(grep 'cacheHit: true' app.log | wc -l)"
echo "Cache Misses: $(grep 'cacheHit: false' app.log | wc -l)"

# Live monitoring (real-time)
tail -f app.log | grep -i "SDK Migration"
```
